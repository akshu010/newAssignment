Summary:
Main Application (Host Application):
I have implemented a main container that serves as the wrapper for the micro-frontends. This application is responsible for managing the design system, shared components, and a scalable architecture that can easily integrate future micro-applications.

Chat Application (Micro-Frontend):
The Chat Application is developed as a standalone micro-frontend, utilizing the Gemini API to provide a GPT-powered chat experience. It integrates seamlessly into the main application and follows modular design principles.

Email Application (Micro-Frontend):
The Email Application is a form-based micro-frontend developed with EmailJS to send messages directly to my email. It demonstrates how external services can be used to implement email functionality within a micro-frontend architecture.

Key Features:
Scalable and Modular Code:
The codebase is designed to be easily extendable. Future micro-applications can be added by following the same modular structure.

Design System and Shared Components:
I’ve created a reusable design system in the main application to ensure consistent UI styling across all micro-applications. The design system also allows easy customization and reuse of components.

Firebase Integration:
I’ve implemented a login/logout system with Firebase authentication to handle user sessions across the main app and micro-apps.

Communication Between Applications:
I have used event-driven mechanisms to facilitate communication between the main application and the micro-frontends, ensuring smooth interaction.

Tools and Frameworks Used:
React for building the frontend
Firebase for authentication and hosting
Gemini API for the GPT-powered chat functionality
EmailJS for sending emails via the email form
Webpack Module Federation for seamless integration of micro-frontends

MAIN POINT:-
If the gpt not work it may issue of free API its free hits gets finish so this may be a issue if this happen it gives error in message instead of the question result
